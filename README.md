## Pagination
```
Pagination is a technique used to divide a large set of results into smaller chunks. This is useful when you have a large number of items to display, or when you want to improve the performance of your application by loading and rendering data faster.

## Caching
```
Caching is the process of storing copies of files in a cache, or temporary storage location, so that they can be accessed more quickly. When a file is requested, the system first checks the cache to see if it already has a copy of the file. If it does, the file can be retrieved from the cache instead of the original location, which can save time and resources.
